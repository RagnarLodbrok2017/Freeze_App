# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Freeze Guard - Partition & Folder State Management Application

### 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** Freeze Guard  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Product Type:** Desktop Application  
**Platform:** Windows, macOS, Linux  

**Executive Summary:**  
Freeze Guard is a desktop application that provides state management for partitions, folders, and multiple directories by creating snapshots and enabling instant restoration to the original frozen state. The application acts as a protective layer that monitors and controls file system changes, allowing users to experiment, test, or work with files while maintaining the ability to instantly revert all changes.

### 2. Problem Statement

Users often need to:
- Test software installations without permanent system changes
- Experiment with file modifications while preserving original states
- Protect critical directories from accidental changes
- Create safe environments for testing and development
- Maintain clean system states for demonstrations or training

Current solutions are either too complex (virtual machines), limited in scope (individual file backups), or require technical expertise (disk imaging tools).

### 3. Product Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goals:**
- Provide instant state freezing and restoration for partitions and folders
- Ensure zero data loss during freeze/restore operations
- Deliver user-friendly interface for non-technical users
- Support multiple simultaneous freeze targets
- Maintain system performance during freeze operations

**Success Metrics:**
- 99.9% data integrity during freeze/restore cycles
- <5 second freeze activation time
- <10 second restoration time for typical directories
- Support for 10+ simultaneous freeze targets
- <5% system performance impact during operation

### 4. Target Users

**Primary Users:**
- Software developers and testers
- System administrators
- IT professionals
- Educational institutions
